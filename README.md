# Profile Card Component

Created with CodeSandbox

##What I Learned
○ adding multiple background images and properly positioning them.
○ border-bottom is more practical than the hr tag
○ letter spacing, I tried to write the text with the letters literally separated, failed miserably.
○ being more flexible with divs, actually, more and more with each passing project.
○ usefuleness of transform: translate.
